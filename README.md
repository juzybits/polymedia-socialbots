# Polymedia SocialBots

Fetch Sui on-chain events and post messages to Discord, Telegram, Twitter.

Currently it only looks at Turbos Finance trades and only posts to Discord.

## Set up API access

### Discord

1. Create a Discord bot and copy the bot token (you'll need it for `src/.auth.ts`).<br/>
https://discord.com/developers/applications

2. Add the bot to your Discord server by visiting this URL. It only needs the "send messages" permission.<br/>
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID&permissions=2048&scope=bot

3. Enable Discord developer mode. Then, right click on the Discord channel where you want the bot to send messages and click `Copy Channel ID` (you'll need it for `src/.config.ts`).
